## 🚦 Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Staging Deployment
```bash
# 1. Build production image
docker build -t ai-saas-app:latest -f Dockerfile --target production .

# 2. Run production tests
npm run test:production

# 3. Deploy to staging
docker-compose -f docker/orchestration/docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# 4. Run smoke tests
npm run test:smoke

# 5. Performance validation
npm run test:performance
```

### Phase 2: Production Deployment
```bash
# 1. Tag release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Production release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# 2. Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy-production.sh

# 3. Verify deployment
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health

# 4. Monitor metrics
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh
```

### Phase 3: Post-Deployment
