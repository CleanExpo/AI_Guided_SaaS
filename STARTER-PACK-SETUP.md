# The Starter Pack - Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Repository Setup Steps

### 1. Prepare the Codebase

First, ensure Node v20 is active:
```bash
nvm use 20.19.4
```

Run the optimization script:
```bash
npm run optimize:starter-pack
```

This will:
- Fix syntax errors
- Remove console.log statements
- Clean unused dependencies
- Format code
- Test the build

### 2. Create Clean Branch

```bash
# Create a new branch for the starter pack
git checkout -b starter-pack-release

# Stage only necessary files
git add -A

# Create a clean commit
git commit -m "feat: Initial release of The Starter Pack

- Modern Next.js 15 + React 19 foundation
- AI integration ready
- Authentication system
- Responsive UI with Tailwind
- TypeScript throughout
- Production optimized"
```

### 3. Push to New Repository

```bash
# Add the new repo as remote (already done)
git remote add starter-pack https://github.com/CleanExpo/The-Starter-Pack.git

# Push the clean branch
git push starter-pack starter-pack-release:main
```
