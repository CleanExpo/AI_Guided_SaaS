## Installation

```bash
cd mcp/master-dev-analysis-agent
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage

### As an MCP Server

The agent runs as an MCP server and can be started via:

```bash
npm run mcp:master-dev
```

Or in development mode:

```bash
npm run mcp:master-dev:dev
```

### Available Tools

#### 1. `analyze_project`
Performs comprehensive project analysis including structure, dependencies, and architecture.

```json
{
  "name": "analyze_project",
  "arguments": {
    "projectPath": "/path/to/project",
    "depth": "comprehensive"  // "basic" | "comprehensive" | "exhaustive"
  }
}
```

#### 2. `generate_todo_list`
Generates a dynamic, prioritized todo list based on project analysis.

```json
{
  "name": "generate_todo_list",
  "arguments": {
    "projectPath": "/path/to/project",
    "phase": "development"  // "development" | "testing" | "pre-production" | "production"
  }
}
```

#### 3. `assess_production_readiness`
Evaluates project readiness for production deployment.

```json
{
  "name": "assess_production_readiness",
  "arguments": {
    "projectPath": "/path/to/project",
    "checklistType": "comprehensive"  // "basic" | "comprehensive" | "enterprise"
  }
}
```

#### 4. `identify_missing_components`
Identifies missing project components and configurations.

```json
{
  "name": "identify_missing_components",
  "arguments": {
    "projectPath": "/path/to/project",
    "componentTypes": ["config", "security", "testing"]
  }
}
```

#### 5. `predict_risks`
Predicts potential risks and issues based on project analysis.

```json
{
  "name": "predict_risks",
  "arguments": {
    "projectPath": "/path/to/project",
    "riskCategories": ["security", "performance", "scalability"]
  }
}
```

#### 6. `coordinate_agents`
Provides coordination intelligence for multi-agent collaboration.

```json
{
  "name": "coordinate_agents",
  "arguments": {
    "projectPath": "/path/to/project",
    "agentTypes": ["validator", "orchestrator", "tester"]
  }
}
```

## Output Format

The agent provides structured output including:

- **Project Intelligence Summary**: Phase, completion %, critical issues, readiness score
- **Critical Missing Elements**: Prioritized list with specific solutions
- **Dynamic Todo List**: Phase-based actionable items with commands
- **Architectural Analysis**: Consistency, technical debt, scalability concerns
- **Agent Coordination Intel**: Validation focus, routing suggestions, resource recommendations

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production" for production mode
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (debug, info, warn, error)

## Architecture

The agent consists of multiple specialized sub-agents:

- **Project Analysis Core**: Scans codebase structure and identifies missing components
- **Requirements Intelligence**: Generates and maintains project requirements
- **Dependency Guardian**: Monitors dependencies and version conflicts
- **Risk Prediction Engine**: Uses pattern analysis to predict potential issues
- **Todo List Manager**: Creates dynamic, prioritized task lists
- **Agent Coordinator**: Facilitates multi-agent collaboration

## Integration with Other Agents

The Master Development Analysis Agent is designed to work seamlessly with:

- **Validation Agents**: Provides pre-validation intelligence
- **Orchestrator Agents**: Supplies routing context and recommendations
- **Testing Agents**: Identifies test gaps and priorities
- **Deployment Agents**: Assesses production readiness

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Lint code
npm run lint
```
