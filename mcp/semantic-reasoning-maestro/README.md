# Semantic Reasoning Maestro MCP

The ultimate agent for human-like, autonomous, and semantically driven reasoning. This MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides advanced reasoning capabilities that merge generative language, symbolic logic, multimodal perception, and autonomous orchestration.

## Features

### ðŸ§  Core Capabilities

- **Unified Reasoning & Architecture Integration**
  - Dynamically invokes language generation, mathematical logic, code synthesis, and multimodal analysis
  - Combines neural and symbolic reasoning for rigorous internal logic and cross-checking

- **Agentic Decomposition & Automated Orchestration**
  - Intuitively breaks down large or ambiguous goals into actionable subproblems
  - Sequences, prioritizes, and parallelizes subtasks with optimal tool assignment
  - Coordinates with other specialized agents as needed

- **Proactive Deep Research Synthesis**
  - Autonomously fetches, triages, and cites authoritative sources
  - Synthesizes unmatched insights combining best practices, real-time findings, and novel logic

- **Human-like Problem Solving Cycles**
  - Emulates top professionals: outline, draft, check, debug, synthesize feedback, and iterate
  - Transparently exposes reasoning chains, intermediate outputs, and data traces

- **Multimodal Understanding & Output**
  - Processes and reasons over text, code, images, diagrams, structured data
  - Incorporates diagram analysis, schematic reasoning, and cross-modal linkages

- **Maximal-Context Memory & Multi-Turn Planning**
  - Leverages vast working memory for coherent, in-depth, persistent interactions
  - Recalls prior reasoning and task states across sessions

// Perform deep semantic reasoning
const result = await semantic_reason({
  query: "Design a distributed system for real-time collaborative editing",
  mode: "hybrid",
  depth: "deep"
});

// Break down complex task
const plan = await decompose_task({
  task: "Build a machine learning pipeline for sentiment analysis",
  constraints: ["Use Python", "Process 1M tweets/day", "95% accuracy"],
  parallel: true
});

// Research synthesis
const research = await research_synthesis({
  topic: "Quantum computing applications in cryptography",
  depth: "exhaustive",
  format: "academic"
});
```

## Architecture

The Semantic Reasoning Maestro consists of several core components:

1. **Reasoning Engine**: Handles multi-strategy reasoning with semantic parsing, logical inference, and synthesis
2. **Task Decomposer**: Breaks down complex tasks into executable subtasks with dependency management
3. **Research Orchestrator**: Manages research across multiple sources with quality assessment
4. **Multimodal Processor**: Handles different input types and extracts cross-modal insights
5. **Memory Manager**: Provides persistent memory with semantic indexing and recall
6. **Self Evaluator**: Continuously evaluates and improves outputs

## Output Format

All outputs follow a structured format:

```
