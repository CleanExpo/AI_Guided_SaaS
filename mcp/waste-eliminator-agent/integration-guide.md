# Project Waste Eliminator Agent - Integration Guide

## Overview

The Project Waste Eliminator Agent is now ready to be integrated into your AI Guided SaaS project. It operates as an MCP server that continuously monitors and optimizes your codebase.

## Integration Steps

### 1. Build the Agent

```bash
cd mcp/waste-eliminator-agent
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run build
```

### 2. Add to MCP Configuration

The agent has already been added to your `.mcp.json` configuration:

```json
"waste-eliminator": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": [
    "D:\\AI Guided SaaS\\mcp\\waste-eliminator-agent\\dist\\index.js"
  ],
  "env": {
    "LOG_LEVEL": "info",
    "ENABLE_ORCHESTRATION": "true"
  },
  "transport": "stdio"
}
```

### 3. Start with MCP

Run your existing MCP startup command:

```bash
npm run mcp:start
```

Or use the batch file:

```bash
start-mcp.bat
```

## Usage Examples

### Quick Project Analysis

Use the `analyze_project` tool to get an immediate health check:

```javascript
{
  "tool": "analyze_project",
  "arguments": {
    "projectPath": "D:/AI Guided SaaS",
    "depth": "standard"
  }
}
```

### Enable Continuous Monitoring

Set up real-time waste detection:

```javascript
{
  "tool": "monitor_continuous",
  "arguments": {
    "projectPath": "D:/AI Guided SaaS",
    "interval": 300,
    "webhookUrl": "http://localhost:3000/api/waste-alerts"
  }
}
```

### Generate Waste Report

Get a comprehensive analysis:

```javascript
{
  "tool": "generate_waste_report",
  "arguments": {
    "projectPath": "D:/AI Guided SaaS",
    "format": "markdown"
  }
}
```

## Integration with Orchestration

The agent automatically integrates with your orchestration system when `ENABLE_ORCHESTRATION=true`. It will:

1. Register itself on startup
2. Accept commands from the orchestrator
3. Coordinate with other agents
4. Report status and results

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Run `analyze_project` with depth="deep"
   - Generate a waste report
   - Review top issues and recommendations

2. **Targeted Optimization**
   - Use `refactor_code` on high-impact files
   - Run `optimize_imports` project-wide
   - Use `detect_duplicates` to find redundant code

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Enable `monitor_continuous`
   - Set up webhooks for alerts
   - Review weekly reports

## Performance Impact

The agent is designed to be non-intrusive:
- Runs in a separate process
- Uses incremental analysis
- Caches results for efficiency
- Respects system resources

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Starting
- Check Node.js version (20+)
- Verify build completed successfully
- Check logs in `mcp/waste-eliminator-agent/logs/`

### No Analysis Results
- Ensure correct project path
- Check file permissions
- Verify TypeScript/JavaScript files exist

### High Memory Usage
- Reduce analysis depth to "quick"
- Increase monitoring interval
- Limit scope to specific directories

## Next Steps

1. **Customize Waste Patterns**: Edit `src/analyzer.ts` to add project-specific patterns
2. **Configure Thresholds**: Adjust severity levels in `types.ts`
3. **Add Custom Refactorings**: Extend `refactoring-engine.ts` with your patterns
4. **Set Up CI/CD Integration**: Add pre-commit hooks to prevent waste introduction

## Support

For issues or enhancements:
- Check logs in `logs/` directory
- Review README.md for detailed documentation
- Modify source code as needed for your project
