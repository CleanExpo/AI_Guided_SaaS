## Current Build Status Summary

After extensive syntax error fixes:
- Fixed 235 files with comprehensive script
- Major progress made on interface/type definitions
- Fixed critical UI component syntax errors (button, card, input, badge, tabs, progress)
- Fixed admin pages syntax errors
- Fixed API routes syntax errors

Remaining issues:
- Still have syntax errors in several API routes
- Need to run one more comprehensive fix
- TypeScript error count significantly reduced but build still failing

Next steps:
1. Create final comprehensive syntax fix for all remaining files
2. Run build to verify all syntax errors resolved
3. Then tackle remaining TypeScript type errors
4. Deploy to Vercel staging
