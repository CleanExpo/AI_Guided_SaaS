# Development Roadmap Creation Workflow

## Purpose
Generate comprehensive development roadmaps with sprint planning, tech stack-specific tasks, and success metrics based on detected or proposed technology stack.

## Prerequisites
- Tech stack analysis completed (stack.json available)
- Project requirements understood
- Timeline constraints identified
- Agent OS create_roadmap.sh script available

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Roadmap Scope Definition
Define the roadmap parameters and constraints:

```bash
# Review available stack information
if [ -f "reports/stack.json" ]; then
    echo "üìä Stack analysis available"
    cat reports/stack.json | jq '{
        framework: .webFramework.name,
        language: .runtime.language,
        database: .database.primary,
        confidence: .confidence,
        redFlags: (.redFlags | length),
        recommendations: (.recommendations | length)
    }'
else
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è No stack analysis - generic roadmap will be created"
fi

# Define project parameters
echo "üìã Project Scope Definition:"
echo "- Project Type: [SaaS/Dashboard/E-commerce/Blog/etc.]"
echo "- Team Size: [1-2/3-5/5+] developers"
echo "- Timeline: [MVP in X weeks/Full launch in Y months]"
echo "- Complexity: [Low/Medium/High]"
echo "- Budget Constraints: [Startup/Growth/Enterprise]"
```

#### Timeline and Sprint Configuration
```bash
# Standard configurations based on project type
PROJECT_TYPES=(
    "mvp:8:2"           # MVP: 8 sprints of 2 weeks each
    "saas:12:2"         # SaaS: 12 sprints of 2 weeks each  
    "enterprise:16:3"   # Enterprise: 16 sprints of 3 weeks each
    "dashboard:6:2"     # Dashboard: 6 sprints of 2 weeks each
    "ecommerce:14:2"    # E-commerce: 14 sprints of 2 weeks each
)

# Calculate timeline based on project type
calculate_timeline() {
    local project_type=$1
    case "$project_type" in
        "mvp") echo "8 sprints, 16 weeks total (4 months)" ;;
        "saas") echo "12 sprints, 24 weeks total (6 months)" ;;
        "enterprise") echo "16 sprints, 48 weeks total (12 months)" ;;
        "dashboard") echo "6 sprints, 12 weeks total (3 months)" ;;
        "ecommerce") echo "14 sprints, 28 weeks total (7 months)" ;;
        *) echo "12 sprints, 24 weeks total (6 months - default)" ;;
    esac
}
```

### 2. Stack-Specific Task Analysis
Extract framework and technology-specific requirements:

#### Framework Task Mapping
```bash
# Generate framework-specific task breakdown
analyze_framework_tasks() {
    local framework=$1
    local complexity=$2
    
    case "$framework" in
        "next")
            echo "Next.js Tasks:"
            echo "- App Router setup and configuration"
            echo "- Server-side rendering optimization"
            echo "- API routes implementation"
            echo "- Image optimization setup"
            echo "- Middleware configuration"
            ;;
        "react")
            echo "React SPA Tasks:"
            echo "- Client-side routing setup"
            echo "- State management implementation"
            echo "- Code splitting configuration"
            echo "- Bundle optimization"
            echo "- Error boundary implementation"
            ;;
        "vue"|"nuxt")
            echo "Vue.js Tasks:"
            echo "- Vue Router configuration"
            echo "- Vuex/Pinia state management"
            echo "- Component composition API"
            echo "- Build optimization"
            echo "- SSR/SSG configuration"
            ;;
    esac
}
```

#### Database Integration Tasks
```bash
analyze_database_tasks() {
    local database=$1
    local orm=$2
    
    echo "Database Tasks ($database + $orm):"
    
    case "$database" in
        "postgresql"|"supabase")
            echo "- Database schema design and creation"
            echo "- Migration system setup"
            echo "- Connection pooling configuration"
            echo "- Row-level security (if Supabase)"
            echo "- Backup and recovery procedures"
            ;;
        "mongodb")
            echo "- Document schema design"
            echo "- Index strategy implementation"
            echo "- Aggregation pipeline setup"
            echo "- Replica set configuration"

            echo "- Session storage configuration"
            echo "- Pub/sub messaging setup"
            echo "- Data persistence tuning"
            echo "- Memory optimization"
            ;;
    esac
}
```

### 3. Generate Roadmap Structure
Execute the roadmap creation script with appropriate parameters:

#### Basic Roadmap Generation
```bash
# Generate roadmap with existing stack analysis
./.agent-os/scripts/create_roadmap.sh --stack reports/stack.json

# Generate roadmap with custom sprint count
./.agent-os/scripts/create_roadmap.sh --stack reports/stack.json --sprints 8

# Generate roadmap for specific project type
./.agent-os/scripts/create_roadmap.sh \
    --stack reports/stack.json \
    --sprints 12 \
    --output docs/development-roadmap.md
```

#### Advanced Roadmap Options
```bash
# Dry run to preview roadmap content
./.agent-os/scripts/create_roadmap.sh --dry-run --stack reports/stack.json

# Custom project path and output location
./.agent-os/scripts/create_roadmap.sh \
    --project-path ./enterprise-project \
    --stack ./enterprise-stack.json \
    --output PROJECT_ROADMAP.md \
    --sprints 16

# MVP-focused short roadmap
./.agent-os/scripts/create_roadmap.sh \
    --stack reports/stack.json \
    --sprints 6 \
    --output docs/mvp-roadmap.md
```

### 4. Roadmap Customization and Enhancement
Tailor the generated roadmap to specific project needs:

#### Risk Assessment Integration
```bash
# Analyze red flags from stack analysis
if [ -f "reports/stack.json" ]; then
    RED_FLAGS=$(cat reports/stack.json | jq '.redFlags | length')
    if [ "$RED_FLAGS" -gt 0 ]; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Found $RED_FLAGS red flags to address in roadmap"
        
        # Extract critical issues for Sprint 1
        cat reports/stack.json | jq -r '.redFlags[] | 
            select(.severity == "critical") | 
            "- CRITICAL: \(.issue) - \(.solution)"'
        
        # Extract high priority issues for Sprint 2-3
        cat reports/stack.json | jq -r '.redFlags[] | 
            select(.severity == "high") | 
            "- HIGH: \(.issue) - \(.solution)"'
    fi
fi
```

#### Recommendation Integration
```bash
# Incorporate stack recommendations into roadmap
if [ -f "reports/stack.json" ]; then
    RECOMMENDATIONS=$(cat reports/stack.json | jq '.recommendations | length')
    if [ "$RECOMMENDATIONS" -gt 0 ]; then
        echo "üí° Incorporating $RECOMMENDATIONS recommendations"
        
        # Add recommendations to appropriate sprints
        cat reports/stack.json | jq -r '.recommendations[]' | while read rec; do
            echo "  üìã Recommendation: $rec"
        done
    fi
fi
```

#### Team and Resource Planning
```bash
# Calculate resource requirements based on stack complexity
calculate_resources() {
    local framework=$1
    local database=$2
    local team_size=$3
    
    echo "Resource Planning:"
    echo "- Frontend Developers: $([ "$framework" = "next" ] && echo "2-3" || echo "1-2")"
    echo "- Backend Developers: $([ "$database" != "none" ] && echo "1-2" || echo "1")"
    echo "- DevOps Engineers: $([ "$team_size" -gt 3 ] && echo "1" || echo "0.5")"
    echo "- UI/UX Designers: 1"
    echo "- QA Engineers: $([ "$team_size" -gt 5 ] && echo "1" || echo "0.5")"
}
```

### 5. Sprint Planning and Task Breakdown
